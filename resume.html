    <h3>Summary</h3><hr/>
       <p>
        I've been a bartender for thirteen years. I've learned how to collaborate and interact with others thanks to this expertise. I work well in a team. I am capable of segmenting tasks into discrete parts. I'm quite creative and love exchanging ideas. Although I'm primarily a self-taught developer, I've taken classes to stay up to date on the latest developments in this field.
